Just as much of machine learning reduces to thinking about norms, it also frequently reduces to angles. The most obvious example might be cosine similarity, but really that gets at a much family of inner product computations in which norms and angles fully specify a computation. For example, you have:

* Cosine similarity
* Correlation
* Covariance -- correlation without normalization
