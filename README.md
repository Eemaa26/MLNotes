# MLNotes
Notes written for myself to keep ML/stats theory ideas organized. Will hopefully be useful to others.

To best take advantage of these notes, you should download the HTML files and view them in any browswer that supports MathJax. Eventually I'll organize them more clearly and maybe even make a PDF, but for now I'm just keeping ideas in a file named based on the central theme of that file.

# Compile Notes
To make sure the notes you're using are up-to-date, it's probably a good idea to compile the notes using the knitr package in R. Once it's installed, you can just run:

    bash compile.sh

which will generate the appropriate HTML files.
