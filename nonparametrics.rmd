Nonparametric Methods:

* Loess
* Histograms
* KDE
* DP models
* CRP-based models
* IBP-based models
* IRF-based models
* dp-Means

Frequentist nonparametric methods tend to have the desirable property of universal consistency.

Bayesian nonparametric methods typically amount to methods to avoid hard-coding integer-valued parameters in a model. For example:  

* Number of dimensions in latent variable model
* Number of clusters in mixture model

Bayesian nonparametric methods do _not_ always have this consistency property.
